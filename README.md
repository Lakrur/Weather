| When you launch the app, you are asked if you are giving the app access to your location. If the user agrees, then he immediately receives weather information for his location, on the example of the emulator this is London. Then you can search for other cities, but when you restart, the weather by location will be displayed. | <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExY2RhYjlmNmM4NTM1MzhhYTk5NjY4YTQyYzkzNDk5NjkwMjNjNTIzNSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZzX2dpZklkJmN0PWc/Vw3CzzAuPF9qypMrF1/giphy.gif" width="300" height="600">  |
